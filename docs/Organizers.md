### [Dr Charles Martin](http://charlesmartin.com.au)

Dr. Charles Martin is a specialist in percussion, music technology, and musical AI from Australia. He uses methods from percussion, human-computer interaction, and machine learning to develop new musical technologies. He is the author of musical iPad app, PhaseRings, and founded touchscreen ensemble, Ensemble Metatone, percussion group, Ensemble Evolution, and cross-artform group, Last Man to Die. Charles did his doctoral research at the Australian National University developing intelligent agents that mediate ensemble performance. At present, Charles is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oslo in the Engineering Prediction and Embodied Cognition (EPEC) project and the RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time, and Motion where he is developing new ways to predict musical intentions and performances in smartphone apps and embedded devices.

### [Dr Enrique Garcia Ceja](http://www.enriquegc.com)

Dr. Enrique Garcia Ceja is currently a Postdoc at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. He received his M.Sc and Ph.D. degrees in intelligent systems from Tecnológico de Monterrey University, México. Enrique was a visiting researcher at CREATE-NET Mobile and Ubiquitous Technologies Research group, Trento, Italy (2014). During 2016-2017 he worked as an independent data analysis consultant for a project between industry and academia on the development of machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data from wearable devices to infer users’ contextual information. Since 2016 Enrique is a member of IEEE eta kappa nu. His research interests include: ambient intelligence, mental health monitoring, human activity recognition, machine learning, mobile health and wearable sensors. 


### [Dr Kai Olav Ellefsen](http://koellefsen.com/)

Kai Olav Ellefsen is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oslo, in the project "Engineering Predictability with Embodied Cognition (EPEC)". His current research focuses on internal models (mental simulations of real-world phenomena), and their ability to improve performance in intelligent agents by letting them predict the future. He holds a Masters degree (2010, winner of the Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Society Best Master Thesis Award) and Ph. D. (2014) from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Before joining the University of Oslo in 2016, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Brazilian Institute of Robotics at SENAI CIMATEC (Salvador, Brazil) where he was part of the FlatFish AUV project. His research interests cover many topics in Artificial Intelligence, including evolutionary algorithms, artificial neural networks, adaptation and learning.


### [Prof Jim Tørresen](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/jimtoer/index.html)

Jim Tørresen received his M.Sc. and Dr.ing. (Ph.D) degrees in computer architecture and design from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Trondheim in 1991 and 1996, respectively. He has been employed as a senior hardware designer at NERA Telecommunications (1996-1998) and at Navia Aviation (1998-1999). Since 1999, he has been a professor at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo (associate professor 1999-2005). Jim Torresen has been a visiting researcher at Kyoto University, Japan for one year (1993-1994), four months at Electrotechnical laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan (1997 and 2000) and a visiting professor at Cornell University, USA for one year (2010-2011). His research interests at the moment include bio-inspired computing, machine learning, reconfigurable hardware, robotics and applying this to complex real-world applications.
